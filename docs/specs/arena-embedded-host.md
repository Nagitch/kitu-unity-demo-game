# Embedded Arena host

Stage 11 extends the [native ABI](arena-native-abi.md) with a shared development
host. Application rules still live in `app/src/arena`; native and
standalone server hosting use `app/src/host`. The native factory and
optional listener are application-owned. Generic C buffer/lifetime behavior
remains in `kitu-unity-ffi`.

## Ownership

`ArenaHost` exclusively owns the right to tick one Runtime, together with its
recorder, playback state, content catalog and command receipts. Creating a router
starts no scheduler. The server supplies a 60 Hz timer; an embedded caller supplies
the ticks through the existing C ABI. HTTP/WS handlers admit work or inspect
state. Owner ticks commit playback transitions and prepared seek results.

Playback controls are committed in queue order, at most one per owner tick. A
successful step response corresponds to one verified replay advancement, with
the response state captured at that boundary. A later pause, step or seek cannot
erase an acknowledged step or replace its response snapshot. Proof failure or an
end-of-recording step returns an error instead of acknowledging advancement.

Original OSC bundle boundaries and complete output order pass through the host
unchanged. Recording captures live outputs and inputs before output presentation;
historical playback cannot overwrite a live run manifest. The native adapter
must drain a complete output batch before requesting the next tick.

## Host inspection

`kitu_application_inspect_host_json` is an additive ABI 1 operation using the same
length queries, caller buffers, size limit and thread constraints as game
inspection. Drivers without host metadata return `[]`. Arena returns one bundle
with `/host/arena/status` and a single `str` argument containing this JSON object:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sessionId` | Host lifetime identity, also returned by `/shell/catalog` |
| `schemaVersion` | Arena contract version |
| `playbackMode` | Existing replay mode object: active, playing, seeking, tick, totalTicks, recordingId, error |
| `readOnly` | Gameplay input is currently refused, including pending replay activation |
| `bridgeEndpoint` | Actual loopback HTTP endpoint, or null when disabled |
| `closing` | Shutdown has begun |

This information is inspected under the same host lock. Session identities and
tooling state do not enter deterministic game projections or replay proof hashes.

Admin/Shell content, script and timeline staging own separate reserved producers,
`host:arena-content-admin`, `host:arena-script-admin` and
`host:arena-timeline-admin`. Their catalogs allocate IDs independently from native
producers `host:arena-content`, `host:arena-script` and `host:arena-timeline`, so
even a native `u64::MAX` ID cannot disable operator staging. Native admission
refuses every operator identity for every command;
network controllers already refuse all `host:` identities. Native metadata and
existing replay identities remain unchanged, and replay accepts recorded
operator identities through the ordinary Runtime queue. Deduplication still
uses each producer's original ID and high-water mark.

## Native configuration and storage

Empty factory configuration keeps embedded TMD defaults, no listener and no file
writes. `bridge.enabled` enables a listener; `bridge.address` defaults to
`127.0.0.1:8789` and accepts a literal loopback address, including port zero.
Requested binding failures reject creation rather than attaching clients to a
different process. The bridge is for local development, without production auth.

`storageDirectory` and `contentPath`, when provided, must be absolute paths.
Storage contains the editable `arena.tmd`, immutable `runs/` manifests and
`recordings/` TSQ1 files. Existing authoring documents are never overwritten on
startup. An explicit `contentPath` selects a separate authoring document.
Source documents are evaluated only through the existing validate/stage flow;
the current run retains its pinned content. Saved detached configuration passed
to the factory remains authoritative for that initial Runtime.

`scriptPath` and `timelineDirectory` also require absolute paths. Storage seeds
editable `boss.rhai` and `timelines/{boss-telegraph,floor-transition}.tsq` only
when absent. Separate caller-owned paths are not created or overwritten. Detached
factory `script` and `timeline` versions remain authoritative; validation and
next-run staging never replace an active run. See the
[presentation contract](arena-presentation-timelines.md) for exact clip timing,
Unity rendering and source-independent replay.

## Detach and shutdown

A native gameplay connection can detach without destroying its Runtime: queue
`/input/arena/disconnect`, clear continuous input, keep management ticks running,
and retain the host/session identity. Reattach inspects current state and requires
an explicit resume. Observer WebSocket disconnection cannot pause the native run.
Legacy WebSocket mutations are refused for an embedded host.

Actual destruction closes admission, notifies observers and cancels background
verification/seek work between ticks. Every host-owned task and the listener are
joined before C destruction returns. Unfinished HTTP requests are cancelled after
admitted host work drains, so incomplete headers/bodies cannot block teardown.
Tokio is shut down on a plain scoped thread
so callers inside an existing async runtime do not trigger a nested-runtime panic.
No timeout abandons native code that could execute after library unloading.

## Validation

`cargo test -p kitu-demo-game-native --test embedded_bridge` uses a real ephemeral
loopback listener. It covers shared session identity, no autonomous clock, Shell
deduplication, native detach/resume, Tanu next-run activation and invalid edits,
old-recording verification, TSQ1 playback/step/seek/live, observer disconnect,
listener release/rebind, incomplete HTTP requests, unread observers, invalid binds
and destruction inside an existing Tokio context. The full native stock comparisons continue using the frozen C# oracle
and ordinary Runtime outputs without host metadata.
