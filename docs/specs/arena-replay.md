# Arena TSQ1 recording contract

Stage 7 of [the roadmap](https://github.com/Nagitch/kitu-logic-processor/issues/129)
uses the public `tsq1` and `tsq1-osc` APIs at workspace revision
`05707147e83a4fba591a3933d49f056bb6d3540b`. No TSQ1 format fork is involved.

## File and exact input ordering

The binary `.tsq` starts with `TSQ1`. A single track stores pairs:

1. Custom event type `0x4b`: JSON `{tick, order, metadata}`. Arena metadata contains
   the Runtime queue `sequence` and optional `{source, messageId, schemaVersion}`.
2. OSC MessagePack event: one immediate OSC-IR bundle. Every contained message is
   `[address, typeTags, arguments]`; tags `i`, `h`, `f`, `s`, `b` preserve i32, i64,
   f32, string and boolean identity. Argument/message ordering and empty bundles
   survive the public codec round trip. Unsupported/nested/scheduled bundles and
   non-finite or lossy f32 values are rejected, never flattened or coerced.

Exact `tick` and contiguous per-tick `order` determine application scheduling.
The 60 PPQ / 1,000,000 microseconds per quarter musical axis is a display mapping;
its deltas must agree with explicit ticks. No elapsed-time conversion or rounding
is used to reconstruct input ticks. Retransmissions remain in the input stream so
normal Runtime identity handling reproduces the original duplicate receipts.

The `KITU` extension chunk contains envelope format 1 and the Arena manifest.
Unknown tracks/chunks/axes are rejected by this application profile even though
TSQ1 itself supports them. The legacy `emit:`/`wait:` text helper remains available
for compatibility, but it is not a TSQ1 document and Arena does not use it.

## Session and version model

A recording starts at Runtime creation, before tick 0. It includes menu, pause,
empty-input and management ticks, all successful starts, next-run configuration
staging and retries. Starting recording halfway through a session is rejected;
there is no incomplete snapshot masquerading as an initial state.

The manifest stores:

- Arena recording/OSC contract versions, application ID and 60 Hz rate.
- Package version, execution hash and compilation target. The hash covers Arena
  rules, Runtime/ECS/core/OSC/transport sources, reference initial defaults, the
  locked dependency graph, compiler version and compilation flags. Unsupported
  builds fail compatibility checks. Keeping an old runtime binary is required
  when execution semantics change; a package version alone is insufficient.
- Full evaluated initial Tanu configuration, its semantic/source hashes and the
  evaluator revision. Every later staged configuration is retained in input data.
- Recording manifest2 additionally requires the full initial boss `ScriptVersion`.
  Every run and later staged input retains exact source, contract and policy hashes.
  The execution hash also covers the Rhai host and bundled script; see the
  [script contract](arena-boss-scripts.md). Older execution versions require their
  archived executable instead of reinterpretation with current rules.
- Initial projection hash, completed tick count, a state and ordered-output hash
  for every tick, and each full run-start manifest with frozen evaluated values.
- Recording manifest3 also requires `initialTimeline`: exact TSQ1 clip bytes and
  hashes. Later staged clips and run manifests retain them. The shared clip codec
  and bundled sources are included in the execution fingerprint; see the
  [presentation contract](arena-presentation-timelines.md).

Replay builds the ordinary application with detached initial content, script and clips, feeds
its normal validated input queue, calls the same `tick_once`, and compares every
state/output before continuing. It never consults authoring files and never
sets HP, actors or clocks from recorded output. Altering the authoring file does
not affect old recordings. Divergence includes its exact tick in the diagnostic.
Hashes demand exact reproducibility within a compatible build; the independent
C# reference comparison continues to allow absolute float error `1e-4` while
requiring exact discrete state, hits/deaths and event ticks/order.

The first recorder is bounded to 216,000 management ticks (one hour), 1,000,000
input bundles and 64 MiB encoded files. Capture validates every OSC bundle and maintains a checked, conservative cumulative
encoded-size bound before appending a tick. Reaching a recorder bound reports an
incomplete-recording diagnostic without stopping live gameplay. Start a new host
session for a fresh recording. This is an explicit initial implementation limit,
not a claim of arbitrary-duration streaming or crash recovery.

## Host integration

All live ticks are captured before committed inputs are drained. Snapshot cloning
holds the state lock briefly; TSQ1 encoding, file I/O and replay verification run
outside the simulation lock. Recording files use SHA-256 content IDs and atomic
local rename. `KITU_ARENA_RECORDING_DIRECTORY` overrides the default
`app/.arena/recordings` directory.

| Endpoint | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /arena/recording` | Recorded/live ticks, session ID, limits and diagnostics |
| `GET /arena/recording/export` | Download a complete detached `.tsq` |
| `POST /arena/recording/save` | Persist the current recording; return ID/path/size |
| `GET /arena/recordings` | List saved content IDs and sizes |
| `POST /arena/recordings/import` | Validate and save a binary TSQ1 request body |
| `GET /arena/recordings/{id}` | Download the saved binary |
| `POST /arena/recordings/{id}/verify` | Re-execute in a separate Runtime and return verified state |

File identifiers are restricted to SHA-256 hex strings. Import validates format,
versions, initial content and bounds; verify additionally executes all ticks and
checks proofs. Invalid files cannot mutate the live run. CPU verification is
serialized. These are local development endpoints under the existing host's
loopback default; production remote operation is outside the approved scope.

## Interactive Admin and Unity playback

Stage 8 adds **Project → Arena Replay**: save/import/download recordings, verify
and load, play, pause, step one tick, stop and seek. Loading checks every state
and event proof before making a recording available. Unity projects the same
verified state and blocks device/command input during replay. Game Parameters
shows the recorded configuration and refuses next-run staging until live mode.

| Endpoint | Request and result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /arena/playback` | Mode, last applied tick, full state, parked live tick, execution/content version |
| `POST /arena/playback/load` | `{id}`; verify a saved recording and queue activation |
| `POST /arena/playback/command` | `{action}`: `play`, `pause`, `step`, `stop`, `live` |
| `POST /arena/playback/seek` | `{tick}`; fast re-execution from the initial state, then pause |

Tick **-1** is the initial state; tick 0 is the first applied input tick. Stop
returns to -1. At the last recorded tick, play/step reject further advancement.
A step request queues work for the host's single 60 Hz owner; HTTP handlers never
advance the active Runtime. Continuous playback also uses that owner and the
ordinary recorded input queue. Seek uses a fresh Runtime outside the state lock,
then installs its verified projection atomically. Invalid targets leave position
unchanged. A divergence stops playback and retains the last verified projection.

On first activation, a normal pause input is committed and recorded in the live
Runtime before it is parked. The host remains responsive while its live Runtime
clock is parked; replay ticks are controlled independently. Return to live restores
that exact paused run, resumes management ticking, and requires explicit gameplay
resume. Disconnect/reconnect retains replay mode and resends one coherent mode,
tick and state snapshot. Live cancels an in-flight load/seek; concurrent seek/load
work is serialized. A seek worker owns its completion and serialization guard,
so HTTP disconnect/timeout cannot strand the replay in a seeking state. During a queued activation, input is already read-only, while
status continues to describe the current projection until the next host tick.

Historical run-start events are broadcast for observation, but cannot overwrite
live run manifests. Live starts committed on an activation tick are still saved.
Paused replay repeatedly publishes state without repeating domain events. Files
and seeks are bounded by the stage 7 recorder limits; seeking starts at the
beginning, so its cost grows with target tick. There are no snapshot/branch edits.

[Stage 8 evidence](../verification/arena-playback/results.json) includes Admin
screenshots and real Unity state equality at the stock 11F death/retry ticks.
Live CLI commands are stage 9.

## Reproduce the stock artifact

Inside the Kitu Dev Container:

```sh
KITU_REPLAY_EVIDENCE_DIR=/workspaces/kitu-logic-processor/.tmp/arena-tsq1 \
  cargo test -p kitu-demo-game --test arena_replay \
  real_tsq1_replays_every_stock_tick_state_and_event_through_eleven_death_retry -- --exact
```

The generated stock `.tsq` and verification JSON cover 5,528 ticks, 550 C#
checkpoints and 53 command outcomes, then compare every Rust state and ordered
output on replay. [Stage 7 evidence](../verification/arena-tsq1/results.json)
also records real macOS Unity input capture, HTTP save/download/import/verification,
and bounds. Generated recordings remain local; the test regenerates them for the
current execution version.
