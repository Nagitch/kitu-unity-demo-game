# Unity Demo Game Verification App

This directory is reserved for the minimal Unity client project used by CI/CD and integration tests.

It pairs with `apps/demo-game` while staying focused on the Unity presentation/input boundary.

## Project

- Unity project path: `kitu-unity-demo-game/`
- Unity version: `6000.5.0f1`
- Version control mode: Visible Meta Files
- Asset serialization mode: Force Text

Purpose:
- Verify that Unity <-> `kitu-unity-ffi` integration remains bootable.
- Run smoke-level checks that the application boundary is not broken.
- Support regression checks for representative runtime flows.

Non-goal:
- Hosting full game-specific implementation.

## Git management

Tracked project state should stay limited to source assets and deterministic
settings:

- `Assets/`
- `Packages/manifest.json`
- `Packages/packages-lock.json`
- `ProjectSettings/`

Unity-generated caches and local state are ignored from the repository:

- `Library/`
- `Temp/`
- `Obj/`
- `Build/` and `Builds/`
- `Logs/`
- `UserSettings/`
- generated IDE files such as `.csproj`, `.sln`, and `.slnx`

Binary game-content formats are routed through Git LFS by this directory's
`.gitattributes`. Run `git lfs install` before adding large textures, models,
audio, video, fonts, native plugins, or Unity packages.

Unity YAML files are marked with the `unityyamlmerge` merge driver in
`.gitattributes`. Developers who want Unity Smart Merge should configure that
driver locally for their Unity installation path.
